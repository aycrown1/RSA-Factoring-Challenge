## RSA Factoring challenge

RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is a widely used asymmetric encryption algorithm in cryptography. It involves two keys, a public key used for encryption and a private key for decryption. It's based on the difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers.

The RSA Factoring Challenge was an initiative started in 1991 to encourage researchers to factorize RSA numbers of increasing bit lengths. It aimed to assess the security of the RSA algorithm and showcase the importance of large prime numbers in encryption.

Prime factorization is the process of decomposing a composite number into its prime factors.

Cracking RSA numbers involves factoring the large semiprime numbers used in the RSA algorithm. Methods include trial division, Pollard's rho algorithm, quadratic sieve, and number field sieve. These techniques aim to find the prime factors of the RSA modulus, which would allow an attacker to compute the private key and decrypt encrypted messages.
